////Suppose you are given a number and you need to check whether itâ€™s even or odd. How'd you do that?

let  number=4 ;

switch (number) {
    case 2:
      console.log("number is even");
      break;
    case 5:
      console.log("number is odd");
      break;
    default:
      console.log("No value found");
  }
